# GD_SlingShooter
GameDev 2

Description
The slingshooter has 3 regular levels and one bonus level. 
The regular levels are a 2.5 D game similar to angry birds. 
There is a slingshot from which you aim of and goals in form of christmas trees and white floating circles.
To gain points the projectile has to hit the floating circles and throw over christmas trees.
When you got enough points you can go to the next level. Per level you need to get at least 3000 points.
After the third level you can decide if you want to end the game or if you want to play the bonus level.

The bonus level is from a first person perspective and at first you have to find three items one after another.
Then a one minute countdown starts. 
Now you have to shoot as many trees as you can within the timelimit so that they fall to the ground.
This score adds up to the previous one

Nice to know
- Song used: 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas (remix)' by Televisor
- other soundeffects were free downloadable from various websites
- Bonus level was developed in an own project and then implemented as package
- In the third level you can activate snow if you hit the right goal
- in the project somewhere is a hidden prototype snowman who follows you
- the maximum of existing projectiles is 5
- escape exits the game except for the bonus level
- if the player jumps off the main platform he 'respawns' at the start position

Have fun playing ! :)
